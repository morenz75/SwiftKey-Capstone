Who knows what Urlacher is like outside of football? But Urlacher's public persona today is what a star professional athlete should be. He still won't give you deep thoughts if he doesn't have any.

It's not easy hiking the 1.2-mile Summit Trail to the top of the Phoenix mountain. But it's a great exercise program not only because of the aerobic activity and muscle building the climb provides but also because other climbers can be so entertaining. Plus it's so crowded you'll never walk alone.

It takes a lot to play that way, but all the top teams play that way. The whole game is about back pressure, tempo and 200 feet.

Industry experts say there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the port of Norfolk. They say it has excellent facilities, as well as railroad connections that Baltimore and other ports can only envy.

Credit for the boulevard's promising start goes to the design concept, which is a collaboration between Jacobs Macdonald: Cityworks and city staff led by the Department of Public Works. If anything, you wish the planners had won a few more battles. The "local" lanes should have bumpy paving to give drivers a tactile cue to slow down, for instance. But the convenience of having asphalt over the boulevard's buried service lines won out with engineers.

SCOUTING REPORT: Kentucky's size, speed and scoring ability from anywhere on the court present nightmarish problems for most opponents. The Wildcats are the best transition team in the country and also hold opponents to nation-best 37.5% shooting.

Anthony Davis, of course, is a shot-blocking fiend with his 7-5 wingspan but has improved offensively during the course of the season. Louisville has trouble generating points but has won of late with a stingy 2-3 zone defense that likes to funnel traffic inside toward center Gorgui Dieng, who averages more than three blocks a game.

Rose, who is having an MVP season, had nine turnovers against Golden State ...Thomas is filling in for the injured Joakim Noah, who has an injured hand ... First-year coach Tom Thibodeau was hired with a reputation as a defensive coach, and the Bulls have reflected that as the NBA's top-ranked field goal percentage defense. The Bulls also rank third in points allowed.

Taylor took over as quarterback after Mertens sustained a rib injury in the fourth quarter.
The Bears seem to believe they will upgrade their offensive line with the return of injured right tackle Gabe Carimi and injured left guard Chris Williams (with the unspoken upgrade of Mike Tice coordinating the offense instead of Mike Martz). But until Carimi proves he can stay healthy and J'Marcus Webb proves he can play left tackle, it's going to be a question mark.

The effort was supposed to be financed by a $15 per acre charge to those companies that hold gas interest to the land. The Maryland Department of the Environment was counting on collecting as much as $2.3 million from the study fee to pay for research. That includes the $138,950 the agency has already spent (and expected to be reimbursed for) on its soon-to-be-released review of industry best practices — essentially the second phase of the agency's 3-part review.

So it was a darn big deal with the Jaguars brought home the Class 1A boys' basketball title over the weekend, a thrill that will linger a little bit longer on the main streets of those central Minnesota cities than, probably, in Osseo, where winning the Class 4A title is much more of a school thing.

If you can read only one book, however, it should be "Titanic: First Accounts" (Penguin), in which editor Tim Maltin gathers classic inquiries and early testimonies from survivors. It is a stunning record of firsthand stories and early reports. "The ship was gradually turning on her nose — just like a duck does that goes down for a dive," recalls radio operator Harold S. Bride. "I had only one thing on my mind — to get away from the suction." The book is full of such accounts, as chilling to read today as the North Atlantic waters were on that fateful night.

Controlling your PC or Mac remotely becomes a completely different thing on the new iPad. The Retina display has greater resolution than many laptops, even. When you run an iPad VNC client (like Screens or iTeleport), the experience is very close to that of having a fully-functional -- albeit slightly slow -- desktop computer in front of you. Even when you're connecting back to your desktop computer via an LTE connection, it's quite a credible experience. There's no need to scrunch the screen down to give yourself enough working room, and you don't need to zoom in to make things legible and useful.
"A dance teacher who was laid off would not come back because a mathematics teacher retired," said John Crowe, superintendent of the Woodbridge school district, where about 25 percent of certified staff was eligible to retire.
Duckworth was a starter on two NBA Finals teams with the Blazers, reaching that pinnacle through hard work and self-motivation. Duckworth attended Thornridge High School, a basketball power outside of Chicago, and did not make the basketball team his freshman year because he missed school the day of tryouts.

The Charlotte Observer, the state's largest newspaper, voiced opposition to the amendment: "North Carolina already bans same-sex marriage by state law so this constitutional change is unnecessary.

I'm beginning to suspect that the Oval Office teleprompter may be malfunctioning, or that perhaps that NBC News producer who "accidentally" edited George Zimmerman into sounding like a racist has now edited the smartest president of all time into sounding like an idiot. Either way, it appears the last seven words fell off the end of the sentence. What the president meant to say was:
In a related issue, Niehaus said that a new congressional map that cleared the House last week could be brought to the Senate floor for a vote this afternoon.

We had dinner at the Crossroads Café in Joshua Tree, a casual, friendly hangout with healthy sandwiches and beer on tap. Ian was welcome here and offered milk with Ghirardelli chocolate. Afterward, I played a little guitar on the cabin's porch without, from what I could tell, waking the neighbors, and we went to sleep. So far, I thought, looking up at the startlingly bright desert stars, so good.
Christie, a Republican, campaigned for GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Brady, who lost the election to Democrat Pat Quinn.

“We are now in an era in which a teenage boy can undergo reoperation for repair of a severe coarctation of his thoracic aorta percutaneously on a Thursday and be well enough to sprain his ankle playing sports the following Saturday (as my son did not long ago),” Gawande writes. “The technological refinement of our abilities to manipulate the human body has been nothing short of miraculous.”
"True Blood" (9 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 29, HBO): With only two more episodes left in the cable drama's don't-blink third season, a seriously disturbed Russell (Denis O'Hare) seems poised for one royal showdown with Eric (Alexander Skarsgard) and, well, just about everybody. Is that why Eric took Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) prisoner at the end of last week's episode -- as bait to lure Russell into a confrontation? Sookie, after all, just learned that she's part fairy and that her blood is particularly intoxicating and desirable to vampires. Any way you play this high-stakes game, Sookie is going to have some major trust issues with the vampires in her life.

This band from Stillwater, Okla., follows the map drawn by its honky-tonk forebears: driving fiddle, and touring the well-worn Red Dirt route through Arkansas, Texas and New Mexico. But lead songwriter Evan Felker also calls up contemporary images, such as the soldier writing a letter "beneath a big Afghan moon" in "Southeastern Son," and a vivid car crash in "Before the Devil Knows We're Dead."

Agatha Christie was not cozy. She earned the title the Queen of Crime the old-fashioned way — by killing off a lot of people. Although never graphic or gratuitous, she was breathtakingly ruthless. Children, old folks, newlyweds, starlets, ballerinas — no one is safe in a Christie tale. In "Hallowe'en Party," she drowns a young girl in a tub set up for bobbing apples and, many chapters later, sends Poirot in at the very last minute to prevent a grisly infanticide. In "The ABC Murders," she sets up one of the first detective-taunting serial killers.

"The insurgency has been beaten back to a considerable extent. This summer offers them an opportunity to not only repulse Taliban attacks like the one in Kabul last month, but also to expand their safe zones and reduce internal (insurgent) sanctuaries, which in turn will - in theory - give the (Afghan forces) and the government an opportunity to set in a little bit more deeply."

The factors that have separated the teams have been minimal, namely the Blues' power play (or, depending how you view things, San Jose's penalty-killing) and their goaltending. Brian Elliott stopped 24 of 25 shots in Game 4, some spectacularly, while the Blues have scored on six of 16 power plays. It will behoove San Jose not to take any silly penalties. Meanwhile, the Sharks have scored on two of 15 power plays.

Greg Couch, FoxSports.com: "The Self image has more than evolved in the past few years, it has transformed. Bill Self used to be a TV-ready salesman with a nice smile, a warm handshake and a friendly little drawl. If he meets you today, he will remember two years later what you were wearing, and ask about specific family members. He could land great recruits, but then couldn't win big with them. It was a classic coaching category: Great recruiter, can't coach. Now, he is a coaching guru, a genius. Did Self change, or was it just his image? Is it just the way we label coaches and athletes, everything so black and white? This is fact: Self has lost early in the NCAA tournament with great teams. The title he won? Five of his players were selected in the next NBA Draft. Who can't win a college title with a pro team? Whatever, this much is also true: This Kansas team is not loaded. The one time Self's recruiting let him down, he has had to rely on his own wits and skills."

Dear Margo: I work for a small company on a team of four women in their late 20s. There's a problem with one of my colleagues that might strike you as odd. "Mary" suffers from severe PMS. Several days before the onset of her menses, she turns into a nightmare. Moreover, she gets a leave of absence for a couple of days each month because she feels ill when she has her period. I'm not a freak who makes another lady's cycle her business, but after working so closely for two years, you just notice such things. In the first months of working together, I sympathized, but it's getting to be too much now. She's not the easiest person to begin with, but during the week prior to her period, she becomes intolerable. I am getting fed up covering her workload when she is out. I gently suggested she consult a doctor. Her answer boils down to "no use seeing a doctor, that's the way I was born." I brought this up to our boss, who told me he is aware of the behavior but is reluctant to let her go because of her knowledge of our company, which is true. Also, he is reluctant to deal with the whole subject. Should I start looking for another job? Should I start nagging our boss? — Feeling Stuck

In Luke chapter 8, we have the Parable of the Sower recorded (verses 4-8). Later in this chapter after Christ is asked about the parable, He explains it (verses 11-18). What is important is that Christ said the 'seed" is God's word. You see, even when we think we have failed as a Christian spouse, parent, teacher or leader of a congregation, as long as we live the faith, teach the faith and abide in the faith, we have planted the seed: the word of God (Luke 8:11-18; Gal 2:20; John 15:10; James 1:22-27).

Meanwhile, some observers have criticized the paper for unmasking lawmiss, and there is some merit to that. It's wrong to offer anonymity, then yank it away.

As NFL offenses have evolved, the role of the fullback -- Jim Brown's position, for heaven's sake -- has been relegated to pure blocker. A series of rules changes since 1974 have made it harder for defensive backs to cover receivers while also providing more protection for quarterbacks.

For adults, there is artistry and allusions aplenty even in Hans Zimmer's score (surely someone will come up with a trivia game to cover the countless film references woven into nearly every scene). There is giggle-inducing slapstick, high-stakes showdowns and even a moral to this story for the kids. All of which combine to create an Old West that is downright good old-fashioned entertaining.
On the outskirts of the city, Tommy and Andy are the first team to discover the next Detour, which is divided into "Grass Fed" or Rice "Field." In Rice Field, teams have to deliver lunch to a group of rice farmers and then plant 300 rice shoots in the mud. The Grass Fed challenge requires teams to fill two bags with grass, collect two lambs and then fill a trough with six buckets of water. Like most restaurants these days, the teams are heavily about Grass Fed, even though it may actually be the harder challenge, what with the sheep herding. As Tommy and Andy collect their grass and walk their sheep, Laurence and Zac, the father-and-son adventurers, soon catch up. However, Laurence and Zac fail to read their clue closely and inadvertently bend the rules using four buckets, when the clue indicates only two per team. Tommy (or Andy, it's hard to tell them apart) warns them to read their clue closely, but they ignore the advice.

Far below us, I spotted the tidy Winter Garden atrium, remembering all too well its shattered glass in the wake of the terrorist attacks.

But in the last few years, pledges from the congregation haven't covered the annual budget. The church dipped into the endowment to meet operating expenses.

DJ Khaled, who specializes in overkill, stormed the stage with a small armada of high-profile collaborators. The Miami impresario shared microphone time with Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Nicki Minaj, Ludacris, Busta Rhymes and T-Pain; each was introduced in turn, and each contributed a verse to “All I Do Is Win”, his latest single. With so many microphones onstage, the sound was garbled at best (Minaj, alas, was inaudible), but the crowd sang along so lustily that it hardly mattered.

The Obama administration sued to block the Arizona law soon after its enactment two years ago.

He was part of a unit that allowed less than one sack per game this past season but was just as skillful as a run-blocker. DeCastro, as many scouts have already noted, may be one of the meanest offensive linemen to come out of college in a long time. Add that kind of attitude to someone with near-perfect footwork and a brawny 6-5 frame, and you’re looking at a decade’s worth of security. DeCastro has the talent to land in the top 15.
"No one gave us any outlet to do anything," explained Sever, who brainstormed the idea with Harris in a public relations class. "You saw that the other night, when the violence of a very small group embarrassed us. We've taken too long to refocus this on the people who matter."
